Please read these Terms of Service (the "Terms") and our <a href="pbPrivacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> ("Privacy Policy") carefully because they govern your ("you") use of our Site, App, and our content accessible via our Site and App. To make these Terms easier to read, the Site and our services and App are collectively called the "Services."</p>

<p>By downloading, installing, or using the Application, YOU (A) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT; (B) REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT; AND (C) ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY BOUND BY ITS TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD/INSTALL/USE THE APPLICATION AND IF DOWNLOADED DELETE IT FROM YOUR MOBILE DEVICE.

</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Agreement to Terms.</b> By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms.

If we do, we'll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site and may also send other communications. It's important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes.
