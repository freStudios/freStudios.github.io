    Note: An Apple Watch with GPS (location services) and Bluetooth LE (4.0) is required to use Phone Buddy. Phone Buddy uses Bluetooth for notification of disconnection. Phone Buddy uses location to display the last connected location. Phone Buddy uses notifications to let you know if a disconnection occurs. Continued use of Bluetooth running in the background can decrease battery life. Other factors such as the Watch's temperature, battery health, and other apps running in the background can also affect battery performance.">
