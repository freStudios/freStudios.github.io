<h1>Our Story</h1>

<h2>One developer and a few friends based in Portland, Oregon.</h2>

<p>In May of 2018 I arrived to the train station and checking for my ticket I realized I didn't have my iPhone with me. Damn, back at the office. I had to turn around and walk back the 10 minutes just because I had left my iPhone behind, again. Why couldn't my Apple Watch, which pretty much stayed on my wrist throughout the day, just let me know that I didn't have my iPhone with me? ... and thus Phone Buddy Notifier was born.  </p>
